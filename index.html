  			<h3>MY STORY</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="story">
			<p>Hi, my name is Lyubov and I teach piano. </p>
			<p>My journey as a pianist started at age 4. 20 years later, I'm still doing it and enjoying it enormously.<br> I've been nurtured in the best traditions of the Russian piano school with its focus on technique and playing music pieces in a "classical way". </p> 
			<p>However, my mindset changed when I started to teach piano myself 7 years ago. From that time on,I've studied lots of different teaching methods and put them into practice in my classroom. I've learned that it is almost impossible to make a standard programme for all my students as everyone has various needs. That is why I adjust my teaching techniques to meet goals of a particular student. Whether you'd like to have a focus on classical music, or you're passionate about popular modern styles, in any case, you are welcome. </p> 
			<p>I love teaching children, and my small students love our lessons too. No child is the same, so I adjust my teaching style individually. Some children need more patience and a slower lesson pace, others a hurricane of emotions. <br> Everyone gets what he or she needs.</p>

					<p>I'm glad we found Lyubov as she helped my daughter to gain back a desire to play the piano. Lyubov is passionate and serious about music in general and teaching in particular. She is very patient with my child, and to me it is very important.</p>

				<td class="reviews">
					<p>I've been learning to play the piano with Lyubov for almost two years now. She teaches me not only how to play, but also how to listen and understand music. She provides interesting theoretical material and helps to overcome the difficulties that I face during the learning process. I started from scratch, but now I can play music pieces that I like.</p>
